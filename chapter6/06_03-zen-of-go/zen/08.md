# Write tests to lock in the behaviour of your package's API
Test first or test later, if you shoot for 100% test coverage or are happy with less, regardless your package's API is your contract with its users.

Tests are the guarantees that those contracts are written in.

Make sure you test for the behaviour that users can observe and rely on.

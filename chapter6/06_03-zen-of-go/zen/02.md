# Handle errors explicitly
Robust programs are composed from pieces that handle the failure cases before they pat themselves on the back.

The verbosity of `if err != nil { return err }` is outweighed by the value of deliberately handling each failure condition at the point at which they occur.

Panic and recover are not exceptions, they arenâ€™t intended to be used that way.
